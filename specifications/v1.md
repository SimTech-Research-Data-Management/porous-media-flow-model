# PorousMedia

This is the preliminary Markdown-file of EXC2075 PN1-3. The main goal of this document is to define a data storage standard for highly spatiotemporal Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) recordings. The data model is still under development.

PIV is an optical, particle-based measurement technique used to measure fluid flow velocities. By illuminating small particles in the flow field with a laser sheet and analyzing their displacement between two consecutive images, PIV provides highly time and space resolved data on velocity profiles and flow structures.
EXC2075 PN1-3 focuses on understanding the turbulent pumping mechanisms in different porous structures topologies with different characteristic porous scales. These fluid flow integereractions between energy, mass and momentum transfer need to be further understood to improve engineering applications such as transpiration cooling, filtration processes and heat exchangers.

To that aim time-resolved and time-averaged velocity measurements were performed at the integererface between a turbulent free flow and various porous structures.
